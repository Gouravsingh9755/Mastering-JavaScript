// course.courseInstructor

// but if there are many objects or we have to use that objectname and value so
// for our eaze we can destructure that value for example 👇👇👇 

const {courseInstructor} = course
// console.log(courseInstructor); 
 
//👆👆👆 create a new variable and write the name of key which you want to access the value 
// after that use equal to = sign and then write the name of that object. 🔍🔍🔍


//👆👆👆 if you feel that some key names or object names are lengthy or you do not want to 
// write that lengthy name again and again so use this method 👇👇👇 
// You can also change the name of that key and then you can directly able to access its value withiout writing full syntex. ✅✅✅🔍🔍🔍


const {courseInstructor: instructor} = course
console.log(instructor);
